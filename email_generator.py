I was researching dental practices in {city} and came across {business_name}.

I noticed you have {review_count} reviews on Google (impressive!), but I also saw something that caught my attention: {main_pain}.

I'm reaching out because I built something specifically for this problem.

**It's an AI chatbot that handles:**
‚Ä¢ Patient inquiries 24/7 (even when your office is closed)
‚Ä¢ Appointment scheduling & confirmations
‚Ä¢ Insurance questions
‚Ä¢ FAQs about procedures
‚Ä¢ Follow-up reminders

**What makes it different:**
‚úì Responds in under 60 seconds
‚úì Integrates with your existing practice management software
‚úì Sounds natural (not robotic)
‚úì Learns from your practice's specific procedures

**Results from similar practices:**
‚Ä¢ 40% reduction in missed calls
‚Ä¢ 3-5 more bookings per week
‚Ä¢ 10+ hours saved on phone calls
‚Ä¢ Better patient satisfaction scores

The setup takes about 15 minutes, and I offer a 14-day free trial so you can see the results yourself.

Would you be open to a quick 10-minute demo this week? I can show you exactly how it would work for {business_name}.

Best regards,

P.S. - First 10 practices in {city} get lifetime priority support at no extra cost."""

My name is [Your Name], and I help dental practices in {city} automate their patient communication.

I came across {business_name} and was impressed by your {rating}/5 star rating. That's not easy to achieve in such a competitive market.

I'm reaching out because many practices like yours are losing 20-30% of potential patients simply because:
‚Ä¢ Calls go to voicemail after hours
‚Ä¢ Staff is busy during appointments
‚Ä¢ Follow-up messages get delayed

**That's where my AI chatbot comes in:**

It acts as a 24/7 virtual receptionist that:
‚Üí Answers patient questions instantly
‚Üí Books appointments automatically
‚Üí Sends reminders and confirmations
‚Üí Follows up on missed calls

**Real numbers from a practice like yours:**
‚Ä¢ Went from 15 to 23 new patient bookings per month
‚Ä¢ Reduced no-shows from 18% to 6%
‚Ä¢ Saved their front desk 12 hours per week

The best part? It costs less than hiring a part-time receptionist, and it never takes a day off.

Would you be interested in seeing how it works? I can give you a personalized demo in under 10 minutes.

I help dental practices like {business_name} capture more patients without adding staff.

Here's the problem I solve:

**Every day, your practice probably:**
‚Ä¢ Misses calls during appointments
‚Ä¢ Loses patients who call after hours
‚Ä¢ Spends hours on repetitive questions
‚Ä¢ Deals with no-shows and cancellations

**My AI chatbot handles all of this automatically:**

‚úì Responds to inquiries in under 60 seconds (24/7)
‚úì Books appointments while you sleep
‚úì Answers insurance and procedure questions
‚úì Sends automated reminders
‚úì Follows up with missed calls

**What dentists are saying:**
"We went from 3-4 missed calls per day to zero. The chatbot caught every single one." - Dr. Sarah M., Austin TX

"Our bookings increased 35% in the first month. Best ROI we've ever seen." - Dr. James K., Miami FL

**Pricing:**
$297/month (less than 1 patient booking)
14-day free trial
Cancel anytime
